#Universal Gates - Detail
In digital electronics, gates are fundamental building blocks used to perform logical operations on binary inputs(0s and 1s). 
Gates are typically implemented using electronic components such as transistors. 
While there are several types of logic gates, universal gates hold a special place as they can be used to implement any other gate. 
Two important universal gates are NAND and NOR gates.
