## Universal Gates 
In digital electronics, gates are fundamental building blocks used to perform logical operations on binary inputs(0s and 1s). Gates are typically implemented using electronic components such as transistors. While there are several types of logic gates, universal gates hold a special place as they can be used to implement any other gate. Two important universal gates are NAND and NOR gates.
## Why we use universal gates
One of the main disdvantages of using the complete sets of AND, OR and NOT gates is that to produce any equivalent logic gate or function we require two (or more) different types of logic gate, AND and NOT, or OR and NOT, or all three as shown above. However, we can realise all of the other Boolean functions and gates by using just one single type of universal logic gate, the NAND (NOT AND) or the NOR (NOT OR) gate, thereby reducing the number of different types of logic gates required, and also the cost.

The NAND and NOR gates are the complements of the previous AND and OR functions respectively and are individually a complete set of logic as they can be used to implement any other Boolean function or gate. But as we can construct other logic switching functions using just these gates on their own, they are both called a minimal set of gates. Thus the NAND and the NOR gates are commonly referred to as Universal Logic Gates.
